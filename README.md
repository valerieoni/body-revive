## User Experience (UX)

        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted.
        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to sign up for a trial session.
    
    -   #### Returning Visitor's Goals

        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to easily find information about upcoming classes as well as the price.
        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to sign up for classes.

        - As a Frequent Visitor, I want to successfully get in contact with the admin or instructors with any questions or challenges I may have.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are orange, blue and off white.

    -   #### Typography
        -  Montserrat and Open Sans are the primary fonts used throughout the website, with Sans Serif serving as a fallback font in the event that a font cannot be properly imported into the site for any reason.
        - Allura is a simple, clean, and legible typeface that was created with advertising and display in mind, among other things. As a result, it is an ideal choice for the logo text.
        
    -   #### Imagery
        -  The large background hero image is meant to grab the user's attention and direct them to the home page. This is also used on the about page to introduce users to the studio's owner.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily get information on what the organization has to offer.

        - When a user first visits the site, they are greeted with a navigation bar that allows them to quickly find what they are looking for. Along with the hero image is a call to action button which encourages users to start a trial session.
        - The site also has the about page which provides more information and an image of the studio owner.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted.

        - The home page features a simple, clearly labelled testimonial section which contains feedback from users. This is clearly visible to the user as they scrolls down the page.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to sign up for a trial session.
        - Once the user visits the site one of the features which stands out is the "Trial Session" call to action button on the homepage.

        - These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        - They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to sign up for classes.
        - The navigation bar clearly highlights the "classes" page
        - The classes, schedule and prices as well as the call to action "sign up" button is clearly visible on the page.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        - The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        - Here they can fill out the form on the page and are given a feedback that they will be contacted.
        - The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page which all open on a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
